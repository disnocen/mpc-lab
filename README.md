# MPC Lab

## Intro

* I need to understand MPC
* using a book [[[insert title]]] to study and learn
* small python script to test my knowledge and to understand better
* maybe in the future it becomes a good tutorial for the book
* plus a real lab for lectures

## NIOT

* Non interactive (NI) 1-of-2  oblivious transfer (OT) in file `ot.py` is based on [Bellare-Micali paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/niot.pdf)
* 1-of-n oblivious transfer is the generalization of 1-of-2 OT as expressed in the [Stanford page on OT](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/crypto/ot.html)(<>)
