# MPC Lab

## Intro

* I need to understand MPC
* using the [Pragmatic MPC](https://securecomputation.org/) book to study and learn
* small python scripts to test my knowledge and to understand better
* maybe in the future it becomes a good tutorial for the book
* plus a real lab for lectures

## NIOT

* Non interactive (NI) 1-of-2  oblivious transfer (OT) in file `ot.py` is based on [Bellare-Micali paper](./papers/bellare89-ot.pdf)
* We extend it to create a `O(n)` version of 1-of-n OT in file `ot_1_of_n_basic.py`

## TODO

* extend from 1 sender and 1 receiver (i.e. a two parties protocol) to many senders and many receivers
* Make the good extension to 1-of-n is implemented based on the [paper by Ishai et al](./papers/ishai03-extending-OT.pdf)
