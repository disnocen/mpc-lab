# MPC Lab

## Intro

* I need to understand MPC
* using the [Pragmatic MPC](https://securecomputation.org/) book to study and learn
* small python script to test my knowledge and to understand better
* maybe in the future it becomes a good tutorial for the book
* plus a real lab for lectures

## NIOT

* Non interactive (NI) 1-of-2  oblivious transfer (OT) in file `ot.py` is based on [Bellare-Micali paper](./papers/bellare89-ot.pdf)
* The extension to 1-of-n is implemented based on the [paper by Ishai et al](./papers/ishai03-extending-OT.pdf)
